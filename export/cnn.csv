Why do we still care about Ernest Hemingway?,"Apr 13, 2021","The widespread yet varying attention drawn by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's ""Hemingway"" documentary series -- which ran its course on PBS last week -- proves, if nothing else, that its subject still lingers in the world's collective consciousness almost a century after his first books were first published.
